This is my website. I'm an iOS and macOS developer, working for [Cognizant](https://www.cognizant.com/). 

Here's the [list of apps I worked on](/apps). I love making all kinds of apps and have worked on over ten apps in four different App Store categories. I also used to edit the [Mobile section of SitePoint](https://www.sitepoint.com/mobile/).

This website also hosts the [articles](/articles) I write about iOS Development (and, recently, Docker), as well as details of [open-source libraries I work on](/open-source) and [talks](/talks) I give.

I love Hackathons (big fan of [Music Hackday](http://new.musichackday.org/) and helped set up the [Music Tech Fest](http://musictechfest.net/) Hack Camp). My hacks won awards at Music Hack Day Barcelona and at [LMI For All Hack Day](http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/lmi-4-all-modding-day).

I studied Computer Science at University College London. Prior to that, I studied Philosophy, Logic & Scientific Method at theÂ London School of Economics and Political Science.
