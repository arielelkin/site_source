>""Ninja Jamm is another example of creative thinking; this is another way for us to consume the music we love, creating something new as a result. We’ve seen several other remix apps before, however Ninja Jamm feels like the best and carefully thought out app so far."

## Titanic Calling

Titanic Calling offers an unusual insight into the final hours of Titanic, a visceral, real time experience of the Morse code signals transmitted between Titanic and nearby vessels summoned to her relief, against the backdrop of a map of the Atlantic ocean showing the trajectory of the ships and the movement of dawn towards the site of the tragedy.

<blockquote class="imgur-embed-pub" lang="en" data-id="a/MwiIy"><a href="//imgur.com/MwiIy">Evino Screenshots</a></blockquote><script async src="//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

The app uses a morse code generator featuring custom-made sound synthesisers that enable viewers to hear as well as watch the messages being transmitted.

## NYLPT

The NYLPT app presents a unique viewing, remixing our urban environments. Randomly generated sequences of Jason Evans's street photographs collected in New York, London, Paris and Tokyo – double exposures made in camera on film – are combined with a randomly evolving soundtrack generated through a combination of 17 synthesizers.

NYLPT is a result of Evans's compulsive visual collecting alongside an informed and intuitive focus that frames reoccurring motifs in a process-driven work. Evans invests in chance, luck and persistence, randomly layering exposures on film in camera; what emerges are delightful surprises – the reward for not thinking too much – and a visual thinking matter that is both familiar and strange.

I worked on the app's architecture, development, sound design, and testing.
