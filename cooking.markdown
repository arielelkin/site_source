Cooking is a member of my eclectic set of passions. I feel very strongly about sourcing quality ingredients, extracting their flavours, and composing a transcendental dish. Below is a selection of my culinary achievements.

*Bountiful post-industrial cod filet on its delicate bed of supermercado spaghetti, accompanied by freshly defrosted verdure. Artisanal tomatonini salsa.*

*Oven-grilled sea cod filet sticks on their bed of frozen garden peas, surrounded by intertwining supermercado spaghettini, with a gentle dash of blended pomodori. Dinner for two.*

*5 oz beef tenderloin grilled over Teflon, with fresh frozen sprouts, and a handful of spaghetti with seasonal pesto (cause I bought it this season)*
